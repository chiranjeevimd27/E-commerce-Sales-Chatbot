## Key Design Decisions

### 1. React Context for State Management
- **Rationale**: Chosen over Redux for simpler state management needs
- **Benefits**: Reduced boilerplate, better performance for small to medium apps
- **Implementation**: AuthContext manages user authentication state globally

### 2. JWT Authentication
- **Rationale**: Stateless authentication suitable for single-page applications
- **Benefits**: Scalable, secure, and enables easy API authentication
- **Security**: Tokens stored in localStorage with proper expiration handling

### 3. Mock Database Approach
- **Rationale**: Demonstrates full functionality without database complexity
- **Benefits**: Easy setup, predictable data, perfect for prototyping
- **Scalability**: Designed to easily migrate to real database systems

### 4. Tailwind CSS for Styling
- **Rationale**: Utility-first approach for rapid UI development
- **Benefits**: Consistent design system, smaller bundle sizes, maintainable
- **Customization**: Extended with custom color palette and spacing system

### 5. Modular Component Architecture
- **Rationale**: Separation of concerns and reusability
- **Benefits**: Easier testing, maintenance, and feature additions
- **Structure**: Components divided by functionality (Auth, Chat, Products, Layout)
